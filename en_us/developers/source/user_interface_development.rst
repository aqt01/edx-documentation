**************
Best Practices
**************

There are a number of best practices to consider before starting to develop
a new user interface.

1. **Use server-side rendering whenever possible**

   Rationale: Server-side rendering gives the content to the user
   immediately without requiring additional round-trips. This can make
   for large performance improvements on slow networks or mobile devices.

   When a dynamic client-side experience is required, then the server-side
   page should include JavaScript code along with the HTML. See the
   technical recommendations below for more detail.

2. **Front-ends should be self-contained**

   Rationale: Front end applications require a variety of types of assets
   that need to be managed together, including code, styles, templates, and
   images. For Django apps and XBlocks, all of these assets should live
   within the app's or block's own directory rather than being located
   in shared locations within the consuming application. Ideally, apps or blocks
   should live in their own repository and should be pip installed into
   the main application.

3. **Designs should be built upon patterns from the edX Pattern Library**

   Rationale: The edX Pattern Library is a collection of web application
   components and visual styles that can be used to develop UIs that are
   consistent with the edX platform. Using the pattern library ensures that
   web applications follow best practices for user experience, theming,
   and accessibility.

   You can learn more in the section `Using the edX Pattern Library`_.

4. **Front-ends should consume and extract reusable UI components**

   Rationale: when developing new applications, developers should prefer
   reuse of existing components over building custom front end logic.
   If a new component is required, it should be built as a new reusable
   addition to the edX UI Toolkit`, based upon patterns from the
   edX Pattern Library. This ensures that future development can
   reuse this component, while also standardizing how it behaves
   for the user in terms of user interface, accessibility, theming
   and so on.

   You can learn more in the section `Using the edX UI Toolkit`_.

6. **Features should work equally well on mobile and web platforms**

   Rationale: Open edX provides iOS and Android applications in addition
   to its web applications, and so new learner features need to be implemented
   for all three platforms. The simplest way to achieve feature parity is to
   provide a responsive web experience that can be used on phones and tablets
   as well as on desktops and laptops. The edx Pattern Library helps with
   this by providing a responsive grid system along with components that
   work equally well on mobile and web.

7. **Designs should be fully accessible**

   Rationale: Open edX measures and evaluates accessibility using the World
   Wide Web Consortiumâ€™s `Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0`_.
   All features merged into edX repositories are expected to conform to
   Level AA of this specification and to satisfy the requirements outlined in
   the `edX Website Accessibility Policy`_.

   You can learn more about developing accessible applications in
   the chapter :doc:`../conventions/accessibility`.

8. **Front end applications should support internationalization**

   Rationale: Open edX is used by learners all over the world, and so
   it is critical that all new functionality can be localized. This means
   that every string in an application should be marked for translation,
   and also includes ensuring that all new user interfaces will switch to
   right-to-left mode when the language requires it.

   You can learn more about internationalization in the section
   :doc:`../conventions/internationalization/index`.

9. **Front end implementations should support theming**

   Rationale: Open edX is used by organizations around the world,
   and each one requires that the user experience is based upon their
   own brand. This includes elements as simple as overriding the fonts,
   imagery and color schemes, to more complex customization of headers,
   footers and registration flows.

   One simple way to make your interface support theming is to use the patterns
   from the edX Pattern Library. You can learn more about how Open edX supports
   theming with the guide `Changing Themes for an Open edX Site`_.

10. **Front end code should be safe from cross site scripting**

   Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow user-supplied data to be
   incorrectly executed as code in a web browser. This can allow an attacker
   to inject malicious scripts, which in the worst case can cause the loss
   of private user data.

   In order to keep your code safe from such attackers, you should follow the
   best practices laid out in the chapter :doc:`../conventions/safe_templates`.

.. _Using the edX Pattern Library:

*****************************
Using the edX Pattern Library
*****************************

The edX Pattern Library is a collection of web application
components and visual styles that you can use to develop UIs that
are consistent with the edX platform.

The edX Pattern Library is available at `ux.edx.org`_.

The edx-platform GitHub repository includes an `example web page`_ that
demonstrates using the Pattern Library. You can use the example page as a
template for creating your own new LMS or Studio pages.

To create a new page using the Pattern Library, you use the same ``main.html``
template as for non-Pattern Library pages, and pass the following context
parameters.

    .. code-block:: none

        {
            ...
            'disable_courseware_js': True,
            'uses_pattern_library': True,
        }

When you create a page using the Pattern Library, create two new root
syntactically awesome style sheets (Sass) files for your page, one for left-to-
right (LTR) and one for right-to-left (RTL) localizations. For more information
about Sass, see the `Sass site`_.

The RTL version of the style sheet must have the same filename as the
LTR version but ending with ``-rtl``.

Register the two new style sheets in the ``PIPELINE_CSS`` configuration. You
can see the full list for the LMS in `lms/envs/common.py`_.

After you register the LTR and RTL style sheets, you refer to the configuration
name in your Mako template. Mako will then dynamically pick either the LTR or
the RTL version based upon the current user's localization preference.

The following example shows how a pair of style sheets are registered in the
``PIPELINE_CSS`` configuration.

.. code-block:: python

    'style-learner-dashboard': {
        'source_filenames': [
            'css/lms-learner-dashboard.css',
        ],
        'output_filename': 'css/lms-learner-dashboard.css',
    },
    'style-learner-dashboard-rtl': {
        'source_filenames': [
            'css/lms-learner-dashboard-rtl.css',
        ],
        'output_filename': 'css/lms-learner-dashboard-rtl.css',
    },

After you register your Sass style sheets, you must also declare the name of
your Sass files at the top of your main Mako file. The following example
declares files that are configured with the names ``style- learner-dashboard``
and ``style-learner-dashboard-rtl``.

.. code-block:: mako

    <%! main_css = "style-learner-dashboard" %>

You can refer to the following examples.

* `Pattern Library test page`_

* PR to convert the programs list to be a Pattern Library page: `PR 12380`_


.. _ui_toolkit:

************************
Using the edX UI Toolkit
************************

The edX UI Toolkit is a JavaScript library for building edX web applications.
The UI toolkit consists of:

* Backbone views to implement patterns as defined by the edX Pattern Library.

* Utility methods to simplify the creation and testing of user interfaces.

The edX UI Toolkit is available from the `edx-ui-toolkit GitHub repository`_ .
For more information about the UI Toolkit, see `ui-toolkit.edx.org`_ .

For more information about writing JavaScript for edX UIs, see
:ref:`edx_javascript_guidelines`.

======================================
Use JavaScript Instead of CoffeeScript
======================================

The edX front end code base is currently a mixture of CoffeeScript and
JavaScript. The edX development team is now standardizing the use of JavaScript
for new work. There are a number of reasons for this decision, including the
following list.

* It is hard to jump back and forth between the two syntaxes.

* It adds a compilation step which slows down iterative development.

* Most third party libraries are implemented and documented in
  JavaScript.

* Client-side debugging is done in JavaScript, which makes it hard to correlate
  to the original code.

* The diff-cover tools are not compatible with CoffeeScript so code coverage is
  not tracked.

* A lot of the traditional benefits of CoffeeScript can now be achieved using
  JavaScript libraries.

All new front end development should be done in JavaScript, while legacy
CoffeeScript code will be converted on an as-needed basis. For pragmatic
reasons, targeted changes to CoffeeScript will still be accepted.

For more information about writing JavaScript for edX UIs, see
:ref:`edx_javascript_guidelines`.

.. _use_requirejs_to_manage_file_dependencies:

=========================================
Use RequireJS to Manage File Dependencies
=========================================

All new pages should use `RequireJS`_ to manage loading
of file dependencies.

* Use the standard syntax to load JavaScript dependencies.

  .. note::

      For the LMS, you have to wrap each call to define or require in
      order for it to work with the namespaced version of RequireJS.

  .. code-block:: javascript

    ;(function (define) {
        'use strict';
        define([...], function (...) {
            ...
        });
    }).call(this, define || RequireJS.define);

* Use RequireJS Text for your templates (see
  :ref:`requirejs_optimization_javascript` for details).

* Create a factory class that is included by your Mako template using
  ``require_module``.

    * This Mako function ensures that the factory is loaded correctly for both
      the optimized and non-optimized pipeline.

    * When accessed in the optimized mode, the query parameter ``?raw`` will be
      added to the URL to ensure that the file is not post-processed.

  .. note::

     ``require_module`` is needed for the unified optimizer pipeline in Studio.

* If you need server-side data passed to your page, pass it as one or more
  parameters to your factory.

  For information about avoiding cross-site scripting, see :ref:`JavaScript
  Context in Mako`.

* For information about adding third-party JavaScript libraries, see
  :ref:`adding_javascript_libraries`.

* If the dependency is pre-loaded, then be sure to specify its path as empty in
  build.js so that the optimizer does not include it in the bundled file. This
  is especially important for files that are used by both by JavaScript
  leveraging RequireJS and "non-RequireJS JavaScript" within the same page.

  .. code-block:: javascript

    paths: {
        'gettext': 'empty:',
        'jquery': 'empty:',
        ...
    }

See an example Mako code block in :ref:`JavaScript Context in Mako`.

The following list includes more examples.

* `Studio Course Outline (Studio)`_

* `Courseware Search (LMS)`_

* `Student Notes (LMS)`_

* `Teams courseware tab (LMS)`_

.. note::

    Using RequireJS in XBlocks is not currently supported. Future development
    is planned to add this support.

.. _adding_javascript_libraries:

===========================
Adding JavaScript Libraries
===========================

Install JavaScript libraries using the ``npm`` package manager.

If the library you want to add is available from `npmjs.com`_,  update edx-
platform's package.json file to reference the library. Use the tilde ``~``
prefix for the version to allow patches to be picked up automatically.

For more information about versioning, see `semver.org`_.

Execute the following command to install your library.

.. code-block:: shell

    paver install_prereqs

Add the new library to the `list of npm-installed libraries`_.

Execute the following command to make your library available as a Django static
asset (choose LMS, Studio, or both).

.. code-block:: shell

    paver update_assets lms --settings=devstack

To add the new library to the LMS, follow these steps.

#. Add the library to the `lms/env/common.py` file at https://github.com/edx
   /edx-platform/blob/master/lms/envs/common.py#L1246

#. Add the library to `lms/static/lms/js/require-config.js`_.

Add the new library to the list of vendor libraries that are installed by
``update_assets``. Update the variable ``NPM_INSTALLED_LIBRARIES`` in
`/pavelib/assets.py`_.

.. note::

    Reference the unminified version of the library. This allows debugging
    tools to step through readable library code, and the Django static asset
    pipeline will ensure that it get optimized for production.

If you cannot use npm, check the file into the `common/static/js/vendor`_
directory.

.. _use_underscore_and_requirejs_text:

===========================================================
Use Underscore and RequireJS Text for Client-Side Templates
===========================================================

The edX development team has standardized using Underscore for all client-side
templates. There are some things to consider.

* Add your templates to a static/templates directory in your Django app.

* If you need mock HTML for Jasmine, put them in a subdirectory named ``mock``.

* Use :ref:`RequireJS Text <use_underscore_and_requirejs_text>` to load your
  templates (note that most code today statically includes the template in the
  page).

RequireJS Text is superior to the old mechanism of statically
including the templates in the Mako-generated HTML for several reasons.

* Mako templates no longer need to explicitly include every template that is
  needed in the HTML.

* The template lookup is much faster when optimized for production use because
  JavaScript code does not have to extract the templates it needs from the DOM.
  For developers, the templates are fetched asynchronously like any other
  RequireJS dependency.

* The templates get included in the minified .js file for the page so the
  content is only downloaded once and then cached in the browser. Including the
  template in the Mako template causes it to be downloaded every time.

* Unit tests do not need to load all the templates into fixtures for the views
  to work, as the view will load its template dependencies directly.

Here are a few examples.

* `Paging Header component`_

* `Teams topic card`_

.. _requirejs_optimization_javascript:

============================================================
Ensure That RequireJS Optimizer Can Optimize Your JavaScript
============================================================

We use `RequireJS Optimizer`_ to optimize the JavaScript that we use in
production. This works as part of the production pipeline to merge all of a
page's JavaScript and templates into a single minified file. This greatly
reduces the number of files that the browser needs to request, as well as the
number of bytes that need to be fetched. Furthermore, in the LMS un-optimized
RequireJS files are never cached, leading to significant performance
degradation.

The basic approach is to move all of the page view construction logic into a
single factory file. This factory is responsible for creating the models and
views required to render the page. The idea is that the optimizer can produce a
single minified file for the factory by statically determining all of its
dependencies.

* Structure your page so that it has a single root factory file (see
  :ref:`use_requirejs_to_manage_file_dependencies`).

  Be sure to use ``require_module`` to load the factory as described above.

* List your factory in the RequireJS Optimizer build file.

    * `Studio build file`_

    * `LMS build file`_

* By default, devstack runs with unoptimized files so that changes are picked
  up immediately.

  To run with optimized files, specify the ``--optimized`` parameter to Paver's
  ``devstack`` command:

  .. code-block:: bash

    paver devstack lms --optimized

* Note that Bokchoy tests run with optimized files to verify that they are
  being generated as expected.

* Be sure to test your page in a production environment, checking that all
  dependencies are included in the optimized factory file.

    * For LMS files, take care that all of the JS files have a MD5 hash code
      between their filename and the js extension. Files without MD5 hash codes
      will not be cached in production and indicate incorrect optimization.

    * Studio RequireJS files currently do not use the MD5 hashing mechanism,
      and instead store files within a unique directory that changes with each
      release. We hope to change this in the future.

=================================
Use Backbone to Build Your New UI
=================================

Code written with Backbone is more modular, more extensible, and more easily
unit tested with Jasmine.

See `How to add a new feature to LMS or Studio`_ to see how to
structure your Backbone code.
